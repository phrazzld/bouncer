# T006 Plan: Implement Script Boilerplate and AI Client Initialization

## Steps
1. Add shebang line to bouncer.js
2. Add required import statements:
   - fs (node:fs/promises) for file operations
   - child_process (execSync) for git commands
   - @google/genai for API access
   - dotenv/config for environment variables
3. Initialize the GoogleGenAI client using the API key from environment variables

## Implementation
The implementation will follow the structure shown in PLAN.md section 5.3 (bouncer.js skeleton), focusing on the initial part of the script that includes imports and client initialization.
