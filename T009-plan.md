# T009 Plan: Implement Gemini API Call and Response Handling

## Steps
1. Add code to call the Gemini API with the constructed prompt
2. Parse the response text to determine PASS/FAIL verdict
3. Verify API call and response handling in a controlled test environment

## Implementation
The implementation will follow the structure shown in PLAN.md section 5.3:

```javascript
// Call the Gemini API with the prompt
const res = await AI.models.generateContent({
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17",
  contents: prompt,
  config: { temperature: 0.1, candidateCount: 1 }
});

// Parse the response to determine verdict
const verdict = /PASS/i.test(res.text) ? "PASS" : "FAIL";
```

### API Call
- Use the GoogleGenAI client initialized earlier
- Call the `generateContent` method with the properly constructed prompt
- Use the "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17" model as specified in PLAN.md
- Set temperature to 0.1 to ensure consistent responses
- Set candidateCount to 1 to get a single response

### Response Handling
- Access the response text using `res.text`
- Use a simple regex test to check if the response contains "PASS"
- If found, set verdict to "PASS", otherwise set to "FAIL"
- This simple parsing approach aligns with the expected response format from the prompt

### Testing Approach
- Test with known diff scenarios to verify correct API interaction
- Test parsing logic with mock responses to ensure correct verdict determination
