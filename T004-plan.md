# T004 Plan: Configure .env for API key and add to .gitignore

## Steps
1. Add the `GEMINI_API_KEY=""` placeholder to the `.env` file
2. Verify that `.env` is already in the `.gitignore` file (done in previous task)
3. Verify that git ignores the `.env` file properly

## Implementation
1. The `.env` file should contain only the API key placeholder for now
2. We already added `.env` to `.gitignore` in T003, so we just need to verify it's working
