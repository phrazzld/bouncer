# T011 Plan: Make bouncer.js Executable

## Steps
1. Use the `chmod +x` command to make bouncer.js executable
2. Verify that the file has the correct permissions
3. Confirm the script can be run directly from command line

## Implementation
The implementation is very straightforward, following PLAN.md section 5.4:

```bash
chmod +x bouncer.js
```

This will add execute permission to the file, allowing it to be run directly with `./bouncer.js` 
instead of having to use `node bouncer.js`.

### Verification
We will verify the implementation using:
1. `ls -la bouncer.js` to confirm the executable bit is set
2. Attempt to run `./bouncer.js` directly (though we won't actually execute it to avoid any unwanted effects)
