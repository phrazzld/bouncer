# T016 Plan: Create git tag for new release upon completion

## Objective
Create a git tag for the new release of Bouncer after all work is completed.

## Analysis
- All tasks T001-T015 have been completed
- A version tag is needed for proper versioning and for users to reference in their `.pre-commit-config.yaml` files
- We'll use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

## Implementation Steps
1. Determine the appropriate version number based on the work completed
   - This initial release will be v0.1.0 as it implements core functionality but is still in development

2. Create a git tag with an annotated message summarizing the release
   - Use `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "message"` format
   - Include key features and improvements

3. Verify the tag was created properly
   - Use `git tag -l` to list tags
   - Use `git show v1.0.0` to view tag details

## Git Tag Message
The git tag message should include:
- Version number
- Summary of major features
- Any notable changes or improvements

## Success Criteria
- Git tag is successfully created with proper semantic version
- Tag message accurately describes the release
- Tag points to the appropriate commit
