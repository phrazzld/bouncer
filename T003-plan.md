# T003 Plan: Create Placeholder Files

## Steps
1. Create the following files in the project root:
   - `bouncer.js` - The main script
   - `rules.md` - The rules file
   - `.bouncer.log.jsonl` - The log file
   - `.env` - Environment variables file

## Implementation
Use the `touch` command to create empty files for now. Later tasks will populate these files with their content.
